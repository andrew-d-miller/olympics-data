Project 1 - 
This project includes an analysis of summer olympics data from 1976 to 2008 and GDP
data normalized for 2010 US$.

The two csv files were merged and cleaned.

Graphs were created to help answer key questions and a correlation analysis
was performed to determine the relationship between GDP
and the total number of medals won by each country.
